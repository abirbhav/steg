# steg
An improved steganography algorithm implemented in MATLAB

//INTRODUCTION

In this era of Internet every digitized object is transferable and exchangeable over
internet for various purposes. As every computer user knows that there are numerous
security threats for digitized objects hence methods like steganography are getting
more importance day by day.

Though steganography is a very old method of hiding information behind some
object, but still this is very effective for secure data transfer and data exchange. Image
Steganography is a thriving research area of information security where secret data is
embedded in images to hide its existence while getting the minimum possible
statistical detectability.

In this project we started with the implementation of basic LSB substitution algorithm
followed by a modified and slightly improved algorithm using LSB Substitution.
Then, frequency domain techniques such as Discrete Wavelet Transform(Haar) were
implemented and the results were compared. Graphical User Interface was developed
accommodating all the various techniques for the ease of demonstration.
